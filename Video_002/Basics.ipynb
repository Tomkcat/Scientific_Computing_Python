    "\n",
    "As of 2019, there are two versions of the Python Language: The Legacy 2.x series and the future 3.x series. Python 3.x came to existence because the founder of Python, Guido van Rossum wanted to add more features to the language. The problem was that adding those features meant dismantling the major framework of Python 2.x and rewrite a significant portion of the language. Consequently, to make sure that the already exisiting programs work well and to make sure the new features get implemented, the old version of python, namely 2.x remained as it is for backward compatibility, while the newer version of python namely 3.x has the new features added to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The result of this decision is the exisitence of 2 distinct versions of python with a lot of similarities on the top, with many differences underneath."

Infact, new libraries are being made in Python 3 extensively.\n",
