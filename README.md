## What is this Playlist About?

This is going to be a long playlist of programming videos meant for using Python as a programming tool for scientific computation.

In this video series, you will learn about the basics of python programming language geared towards applications in science and mathematics.

I have a broad outline of what concepts I will make videos about in this playlist. I'll add more videos as I go along with the series.

## Reference Books

Obviously, I cannot pull-out applications by myself. So, I'll be referring to these books for good programming exercises and ideas. So, if you want some study material for more details, feel free to refer to these books.

* Computational Physics - Problem Solving with Python, Third Edition, Rubin H. Landau, Manuel J, Paez, and Cristian C. Boudeianu, Wiley Publications
* A Primer on Scientific Programming with Python, Third Edition, Hans Petter Langtangen, Springer

I'll add more books whenever I find them. Occassionally, I might find new topics that might not be in these text books. In that case, i'll include links or reference material as I go about with them!
